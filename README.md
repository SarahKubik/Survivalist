Are you worried about the end of the world? A civil war? Just tired of your neighbors? Do you believe in being prepared for every event? Do you believe in "Survivalism"?

* [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)

### Installation

Using the Apollo Server, the backend was was developed and intergrated with the front end client. Graphlql was setup as the database while Concurrently acted as the middleware connecting the back and frontend seamlesslly.

Routes, mutations, and typesdefs were built to speak to the front end for the application to be fully interactive. Bootstrap and Styled Components were used to style the front end.
